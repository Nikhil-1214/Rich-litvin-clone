            <h1>Great Leaders are Great Coaches</h1><br><br>
            <h5>For most of human history it wasn’t called coaching, it was called leadership. We teach successful
                leaders to become highly successful, professional coaches.</h5>
            <hr>
            <p>
                We are the world’s premier company at helping elite leaders become elite professional coaches. We have
                launched many of the most successful and most exclusive coaches on the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
                We help coaches build a thriving practice with a few high-performing, high-fee clients – one powerful
                conversation at a time. They build their business by word of mouth, by serving deeply and by being
                remarkable. No email list. No facebook ads. Not even a business card.

            </p>
            <p>
                Would you like to build a coaching or consulting practice with just a few high-performing, high fee
                clients – by word-of-mouth alone?

            </p>
            <p>It’s what we do.</p>

                    <span style="color: #676767;">But I paid a high price to be a leader
                        and a trailblazer. I thrived under pressure and I also burned out. Rich has been my coach for
                        several years and he regularly reminds me how powerful I am. He helps me achieve new levels of
                        success on the outside and on the inside. I now have a business I love, I travel the world with
                        my
                        partner and I am healthier than I have ever been. I can’t recommend Rich’s coaching highly
                        enough.”</span><br>
